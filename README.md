# FeOFu - Compiler Seminar
Features of the Future

In this repository we'd like to collect ideas that would lead to better compilers for existing languages, better future programming languages, better APIs and better performance software solutions in the future.

**We also have a regular meeting on these topic every Monday 15:00-17:00 at ELTE Lágymányos, Chemistry Building, room 115.**
